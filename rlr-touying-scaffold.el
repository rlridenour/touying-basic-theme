;;; rlr-touying-scaffold.el --- Scaffold a new Touying presentation -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Creates a new Touying presentation directory containing config.typ,
;; a slug-prefixed talk.org (e.g. my-talk-talk.org, so it's findable by
;; name alone rather than being one of many identically-named talk.org
;; files), a live slide deck, and a flowing handout, following the
;; config.typ / content.typ / slides.typ / handout.typ pattern where the
;; slide deck and handout are the two things you actually compile.
;; content.typ itself is generated from talk.org via ox-touying.el (if
;; loaded) -- edit talk.org and re-export rather than hand-editing
;; content.typ.
;;
;; Uses the "basic-theme" Touying package (@local/basic-theme:0.1.0):
;; heading levels map onto section (=) / frame (==) by default (pass
;; slide-level: 3 for a talk that needs a subsection (==) level between
;; them, with frames at ===), the theme supports "white"/"black"/"gray"
;; variants, and plain content under a heading needs no wrapper -- it
;; becomes a slide automatically, which keeps content.typ close to a
;; plain Org-mode export. The generated handout numbers every heading
;; (1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, ...) and draws a line above each handout-note, to
;; mark reader-only text that wasn't part of what the audience saw.
;;
;; Usage: M-x rlr/new-touying-presentation
